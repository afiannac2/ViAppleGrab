IMPORTANT: The interaction between the different components of the game is 
done through an event based structure. It is important that any components
which need to subscribe to an event of another component do so in their
respective Initialize() methods. By subscribing in the Initialize() method,
the order of the event methods invoked will always be 1. Input, 2. Logic, 
3. Sound, 4. Main Game. If events are subscribed to outside of the Initialize
method, it may cause errors due to the order of updates (a difficult to debug
error!)

TODO:

1. Record the game instructions
2. Record the Welcome3 file which should say, "Ok, here we go. Lets grab some apples!"
